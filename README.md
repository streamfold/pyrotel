## Description

This package provides an embedded OpenTelemetry collector, built on the lightweight [Rotel](https://github.com/streamfold/rotel) collector. When started, it spawns a background daemon that accepts OpenTelemetry metrics, traces, and logs. Designed for minimal overhead, Rotel reduces resource consumption while simplifying telemetry collection and processing in complex Python applicationsâ€”without requiring additional sidecar containers.

By default, the Rotel agent listens for OpenTelemetry (OTel) data over **gRPC (port 4317)** and **HTTP (port 4318)** on _localhost_. It efficiently batches telemetry signals and forwards them to a configurable OTLP endpoint. Future updates will introduce support for additional filtering, transformations, and exporters.

## Getting started

### Rotel configuration

Add the `rotel` Python package to your project's dependencies. There are two approaches to configuring rotel:
1. typed config dicts
2. environment variables

#### Typed dicts

In the startup section of your `main.py` add the following code block. Replace the endpoint with the endpoint of your OpenTelemetry vendor and any required API KEY headers. 

```python
from rotel import OTLPExporter, Rotel

rotel = Rotel(
    enabled = True,
    exporter = OTLPExporter(
        endpoint = "https://foo.example.com",
        custom_headers=[f"x-api-key={settings.API_KEY}"]
    ),
)
rotel.start()
```

#### Environment variables

You can also configure rotel entirely with environment variables. In your application startup, insert:
```python
import rotel
rotel.start()
```

In your application deployment configuration, set the following environment variables. These match the typed configuration above:
* `ROTEL_ENABLED=true`
* `ROTEL_OTLP_EXPORTER_ENDPOINT=https://foo.example.com`
* `ROTEL_OTLP_EXPORTER_CUSTOM_HEADERS=x-api-key={API_KEY}`

Any typed configuration options will override environment variables of the same name.

---

See the [*Configuration*](#configuration) section for the full list of options.

### OpenTelemetry SDK configuration

Once the rotel collector agent is running, you may need to configure your application's instrumentation. If you are using the default rotel endpoints of *localhost:4317* and *localhost:4318*, then you should not need to change anything. 

To set the endpoint the OpenTelemetry SDK will use, set the following environment variable:

* `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4317`

## Configuration

This is the full list of options and their environment variable alternatives. Any defaults left blank in the table are either False or None.

| Option Name        | Type         | Environ                  | Default              | Options         |
|--------------------|--------------|--------------------------|----------------------|-----------------|

| otlp_grpc_endpoint | str          | ROTEL_OTLP_GRPC_ENDPOINT | localhost:4317       |                 |
| otlp_http_endpoint | str          | ROTEL_OTLP_HTTP_ENDPOINT | localhost:4318       |                 |
| pid_file           | str          | ROTEL_PID_FILE           | /tmp/rotel-agent.pid |                 |
| log_file           | str          | ROTEL_LOG_FILE           | /tmp/rotel-agent.log |                 |
| debug_log          | list[str]    | ROTEL_DEBUG_LOG          |                      | traces, metrics |
| exporter           | OTLPExporter |                          |                      |                 |

The OTLPExporter can be enabled with the following options.

| Option Name     | Type      | Environ                             | Default | Options      |
|-----------------|-----------|-------------------------------------|---------|--------------|

| protocol        | str       | ROTEL_OTLP_EXPORTER_PROTOCOL        | grpc    | grpc or http |
| custom_headers  | list[str] | ROTEL_OTLP_EXPORTER_CUSTOM_HEADERS  |         |              |

| tls_cert_file   | str       | ROTEL_OTLP_EXPORTER_TLS_CERT_FILE   |         |              |
| tls_key_file    | str       | ROTEL_OTLP_EXPORTER_TLS_KEY_FILE    |         |              |

| tls_skip_verify | bool      | ROTEL_OTLP_EXPORTER_TLS_SKIP_VERIFY |         |              |

## Debugging

If you set the option `debug_log` to `["traces"]`, or the environment variable `ROTEL_DEBUG_LOG=traces`, then rotel will log a summary to the log file `/tmp/rotel-agent.log` each time it processes trace spans. You can add also specify *metrics* to debug metrics.   

## Development

Install the latest version of the [hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/install/) build tool. We'll use this to manage the environments, run tests and perform builds.

### Managing Python versions

Hatch will default to the system's Python version.
If you want to install additional Python versions, you can use `hatch` to manage those.
The following will install Python 3.9:

```shell
hatch python install 3.9
```

Then you can run tests against version 3.9 with:
```shell
hatch run test.py39:pytest
```

### Wheel builds

To build locally using an existing Rotel agent binary, run:
```shell
hatch run build:me ../path/to/agent/file
```

You can always download the latest rotel agent binary from Github. Make sure to create a Github Personal Access Token (PAT) that allows you to pull Github release artifacts. Set that as `GITHUB_API_TOKEN` for the commands below. 

To build using the latest Github built binary:
```shell
GITHUB_API_TOKEN=1234 hatch run build:me
```

Finally, to build for all supported platforms:
```shell
GITHUB_API_TOKEN=1234 hatch run build:all
```

### Linting and formatting

```shell
hatch run lint:fmt    # will fix anything it can, report others
hatch run lint:check  # will only report issues
```
